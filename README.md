# Spectrogram Visualizer for Audio Data Experimentation

Real-time audio spectrogram visualizer using Web Audio API and Canvas API. This project is a fork of [spectro](https://github.com/calebj0seph/spectro), with deprecation fixes and improved implementations. This is used as a helper app to help me experiment with finding the optimal audio processing scheme for Deep Learning tasks.
